# What is this

This is my practice project (1) to study how to use web APIs with qiita's one and (2) to get used to development on git-environments (github, gitlab).

# My rules (I'm careful to)

- develop with git-flow and github-flow

- always start with an issue

- short lived feature branch

- develop in multiple devices (mac, windows, linux)
